# Roadmap

*Background
* *Done for Making data count, a collaboration...

* Methods
* *online surveys distributed via social media and listservs

* Researcher demographics:
* *N=247
* *78% academic
* *57% US, 14% UK
* *53% biology, 17% environmental science, 10% social science

*Data discovery
* *63% "definitely" use two or more methods to look for data
* *Use of disciplinary databases, the literature, and general-purpose search engines is roughly similar (59%, 58%, and 51% definite respectively)
* *Social-ish methods are much less well used (but private communications wasn't addressed)

*Quality
* *good documentation is the most important factor (52% #1)
* *surprisingly, reuse is the least important factor (48% #5)
* *consistent with PLOS paper (Kratz and Strasser, 2015)

*Impact
* *Citations overwhelmingly the first choice (85% #1)
* *Downloads the second (64% %2)
* *Pageviews last at 60% least interesting.

* Repo. demographics:
* *N=73
* *64% academic, 22% government
* *72% US, 11% UK

* Metrics tracked and exposed
* *Downloads the most tracked (85%)
* *Views second (66%)
* *Citations to datasets (the most desireable to researchers) 23%

* Many fewer exposed via API or displayed on item page than tracked
* *30% downloads
* *27% views
* *11% citations

Reop interest
* *citations the most interesting to 61%
* *landing pages the least to 51%

*Practical conclusions
* *citations are the most valuable to everyone
* *repos should expose stats downloads and citations
* *views and links are less important
* *data citation is good, collecting that info is good
