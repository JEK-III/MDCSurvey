We have now discussed your brief outline of this potential Comment article.  We feel that the topic is appropriate for Scientific Data, and we would be glad to consider a more complete submission.  Naturally, we can make no firm commitment until we seen a more detailed draft, but we do feel that this topic would likely be of interest to our readership.  

If you could provide us with a detailed outline of the piece you envision, or a draft if one already exists, we can then advise you further on how best to format this work.  We envision that this work could either be considered as a standalone Comment article, or as a Comment associated with a Data Descriptor manuscript -- if more space is needed to describe the survey methodology.  With your draft or outline, we would appreciate an estimate on when you would hope to submit your manuscript in full.

Comment articles at Scientific Data are short pieces written for a broad scientific audience. They are generally 1-3 pages of printed text, with one figure or table as needed, and a maximum of 25 references.  They should not contain methods or results sections, or supplementary materials -- but they may be associated with data records stored at a public repositories like Dryad or figshare. They may or may not be peer-reviewed in depth, depending on the content, but they are always cleared through our Editorial Board. You can see our two published Comments here: http://www.nature.com/sdata/archive?type=Comment.

As a condition of submission, we would ask you to archive the survey data in line with our usual data deposition requirements, after appropriate anonymization of course (http://www.nature.com/sdata/data-policies). Please let me know if this will be a problem. Our default data repositories for data of this kind would be Dryad or figshare, but it would be completely acceptable if you wish to host the survey data at a CDL repository, assuming that you can issue a DataCite DOI for it.  

I hope this seems reasonable.  Please let me know if you have any questions, and please do feel free to give me a call (+44 20 70146612) or look for me on Skype (username: scientificdata) if you want to chat about any of the above points.

My CDL colleague Carly Strasser suggested I contact you about a potential comment for Scientific Data. Carly and I have been working on an NSF-funded project with PLOS and DataONE to develop a Dataset-Level Metrics tool. As part of the research phase of this project, we have conducted a survey of data managers and researchers about data metrics. We think that the results of this survey are relevant to a broader community and would be of wide interest.

We asked ~250 researchers how they discover and re-use data, how they assess the quality and impact of other researchers, and what they would like to know about their own data. The questions for ~75 data managers focused on what metrics they currently collect, what they make public, and what they would like to know. The replies affirm the importance of citation counts for both groups, although few repositories track them.
Download counts are a clear second-choice for researchers that most repositories do track, but most of those repositories donÂ¹t report the counts.
