% Introduction
% ==============================================================

Data undergirds all of science, yet scientists, funders, and administrators often fail to recognize data sharing or publication as valuable scholarship.
One essential component of such recognition would be an accepted set of metrics to gauge the contribution made by any given dataset.
An article's significance has long been estimated by counting the number of subsequent articles that cite it. 
Now, a suite of internet-based alternative metrics (``altmetrics'') seek to provide faster assessment and capture other kinds of impact\cite{priem_altmetrics_2012}.
Data descriptor articles published in journals like \textit{Earth Systems Science Data} or \textit{Scientific Data} could serve as traditionally-measurable proxies for datasets\cite{@pfeiffenberger_earth_2008, @editors_more_2014}.
Datasets themselves are susceptible to many of the same metrics as articles-- but the translation is not straightforward.
The activities of viewing a landing page, downloading, or citing are all likely to have different significance in relation to a dataset than an article.
Multiple efforts are underway investigate traditional, alternative, and novel metrics for data: the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Data Bibliometrics Working Group (\url{http://rd-alliance.org/group/rdawds-publishing-data-bibliometrics-wg/case-statement/rdawds-publishing-data-bibliometrics-wg}{}); the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Alternative Assessment Metrics Initiative (\url{http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/}), which explicitly considers altmetrics for non-traditional products like software and data; and Making Data Count (\url{http://mdc.plos.org}), a collaboration between the California Digital Library, the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and DataONE to define a suite of Data Level Metrics (DLMs) and adapt the existing PLOS Article Level Metric (ALM) tool(\url{http://alm.plos.org}) to capture them.

% ==============================================================
% Methods and Demographics
% ==============================================================

To define useful DLMs, we must understand the values and needs of the researchers who create and re-use data, and of the data managers who preserve and publish it.
During the research phase of Making Data Count, we asked researchers and database or repository staff questions about data sharing, discovery, and metrics.
We solicited responses to a pair of online surveys via social media, listservs, and posts to CDL and PLOS blogs-- ultimately hearing from 247 researchers and 73 data managers in November and December of 2014.
Most researchers worked at academic institutions (78\%), and most were based in the United States (57\%) or United Kingdom (14\%).
Both academic (64\%) and government-run (22\%) repositories were significantly represented; repositories were primarily located in the United States (72\%) or United Kingdom (11\%).
Researchers from across the academic career spectrum responded; principal investigators, postdocs, and grad students were all well represented. 
Biology is the most popular discipline (53\%), but environmental (17\%) and social (10\%) science are also significantly represented. 

% ==============================================================
% Locations for sharing & discovery
% ==============================================================

To situate the collection and display of data metrics, we wanted to know where on the internet researchers go to share their data and to find data to use. 
Data sharing behavior has been relatively well-surveyed\cite{@tenopir_data_2011, @akers_disciplinary_2013, @wallis_if_2013, @aydinoglu_data_2014, @kratz_researcher_2015}. 
Consistent with previous surveys, direct transmission (e.g., via email) on request was the most common behavior, and 74\% of respondents had shared some data this way and 16\% had shared ``most/all'' of their data that way.
Among the drawbacks to this approach-- including duplicated effort, the potential for capricious denial of access, and the absence of any component of preservation-- is that it is invisible to measurement. 
Fortunately, the most tractable method, publication via a database or repository, is also in wide use.
It is the most common channel for sharing most/all of the data (used by 24\%, presumably because database upload is more likely to be systematic than responding to particular requests) and another 47\% shared some of their data that way.

How and where scientists search for data in their role as (re-)users has been less well studied, so we asked researchers how likely they would be to use each of five possible strategies.
No single method predominated.
A 63\% majority said that they would ``definitely'' use more than one strategy, and three strategies would definitely be used by most respondents: searching via references in the literature (59\%), a discipline-specific database (58\%), or a general purpose search engine (51\%). 
When asked to name particular sources, the general-purpose repository Dryad (\url{http://datadryad.org/}) was most frequently mentioned ($n=16$); Google and ``journal articles'' were tied for second ($n=14$). 
Respondents were unlikely to `crowd-source' data discovery via open inquiries on social media (42\% ``no chance'') or discussion forums (40\% no chance).
However, direct inquiries to knowledgeable colleagues are probably more common, and were a relatively highly cited write-in source ($n=12$).

We sought to characterize the role of public data in respondents research process by asking how frequently they used public data to generate ideas/hypotheses at the outset, to reach the main conclusion of a paper, or to support the main conclusion of a paper; we additionally asked whether they had ever used public data to reproduce of confirm a published analysis.
A large 96\% of respondents said that they at least ``occasionally'' used public data in at least one capacity; a smaller 56\% majority used public data ``often'' in at least one capacity.
Furthermore much of this use is central to research, 28\% often and 42\% occasionally use public data to reach the main conclusions of a paper, although use for idea generation (41\% often, 46\% occasionally) and support (39\% often, 47\% occasionally) were higher.


% ==============================================================
% Information about data users
% ==============================================================

The primary consumer of DLMs are researchers  creators themselves; metrics can provide a sense of what data is being used for and reassure them that it is being used and that sharing is worthwhile.
Data managers have a stake in knowing about users of their data to justify funding and tailor services.
We asked what researchers would be most interested to know about users of their data and, not surprisingly, many wanted to know everything: researchers chose ``name and contact information'' as their first choice than any other option (48\%).
However, a significant fraction (13\%) ranked this option last (of five), and the highest average interest in discipline was slightly higher.
The least interesting option we presented was geographic location, put in last place by 58\%.
Data managers overwhelmingly chose discipline as the most interesting thing to know about users of their data (67\%).
The current practices of repositories were split roughly in half between repositories that require a name (47\%), email address (44\%), and institutional affiliation (40\%) and those that provide data without collecting any information (47\%).

% ==============================================================
% Information about data impact 
% ==============================================================

As a measure of impact, citations are still the coin of the realm.
When asked to rank potential information about data use, 85\% of researchers and 61\% of data managers chose citations as the most interesting thing to know about their data(Figure \ref{fig:results}b,c). 
The preference of researchers is consistent with previous surveys\cite{@kratz_researcher_2015}, but it is more surprising that data managers prefer a purely scholarly measure so clearly over ``real world'' impact (ranked first by only 23\%). 
Download count was a consistent second choice of researchers (by 64\%). 
Landing page views were ranked last by >50\% of both researchers and data managers.

As a practical matter, it is important to understand what metrics are already being tracked and exposed by repositories(Figure \ref{fig:results}d). 
We found that most repositories track downloads (85\%) and landing page views (66\%). 
However, only 35\% of the repositories that track downloads expose them via API or display on the landing page; this ratio is roughly similar for all of the metrics we asked about. 
Despite the extreme interest in citation counts, relatively few repositories (23\%) track them. 

% ==============================================================
% Conclusions & future work 
% ==============================================================

Citation counts are the gold standard, but there are two major obstacles to citation counts: one is that data is often not cited formally; the other is that the infrastructure to track data citations isn't entirely in place.
The scholarly communication community recognized the consensus that data used in an article should be cited formally in the reference list with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (\url{http://www.force11.org/node/4769}). 
Researchers agree: 95\% of respondents to a DataONE survey agreed that formal citation was a fair condition for data sharing, as did 87\% of astrobiologists in a follow-up survey \cite{@tenopir_data_2011, @aydinoglu_data_2014}. 
Citation``in the references like normal publications'' is the preferred method of receiving credit for data sharing by 71\% of biodiversity researchers and by 75\% of respondents to our earlier survey \cite{@enke_users_2012, @kratz_researcher_2015}.
The Thomson-Reuters Data Citation Index (\url{http://thomsonreuters.com/data-citation-index/}) is a good start, but we need to firm up this infrastructure.
% something about citation harvesting infrastructure
% maybe something about data journals

Download counts and page views are much more manageable.
Downloads are considered valuable.
Page views aren't.
Repositories should collect and expose DLs at least.

\section*{Figures Legends}

Figure should be referred to using a consistent numbering scheme through
the entire Data Descriptor. For initial submissions, authors may choose
to supply this document as a single PDF with embedded figures, but
separate figure image files must be provided for revisions and accepted
manuscripts. In most cases, a Data Descriptor should not contain more
than three figures, but more may be allowed when needed. We discourage
the inclusion of figures in the Supplementary Information \textendash{}
all key figures should be included here in the main Figure section. 

Figure legends begin with a brief title sentence for the whole figure
and continue with a short description of what is shown in each panel,
as well as explaining any symbols used. Legend must total no more
than 350 words, and may contain literature references.
