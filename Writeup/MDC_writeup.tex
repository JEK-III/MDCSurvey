% Introduction
% ==============================================================

Data undergirds all of science and should be recognized as valuable scholarship, which requires an accepted set of metrics to gauge the contribution made by any given dataset.
An article's significance has long been estimated by counting the number of subsequent articles that cite it. 
Now, a suite of internet-based alternative metrics (``altmetrics'') seek to provide faster assessment and capture other kinds of impact\cite{priem_altmetrics_2012}.
Data descriptor articles published in journals like \textit{Earth Systems Science Data} or \textit{Scientific Data} could serve as traditionally-measurable proxies for datasets\cite{pfeiffenberger_earth_2011, editors_more_2014}.
Datasets themselves are susceptible to many of the same metrics as articles-- but the translation is not straightforward.
The activities of viewing a landing page, downloading, or citing are all likely to have different significance in relation to a dataset than an article.

Multiple efforts are underway investigate traditional, alternative, and novel metrics for data: the Research Data Alliance Data Bibliometrics Working Group (\url{http://rd-alliance.org/group/rdawds-publishing-data-bibliometrics-wg/case-statement/rdawds-publishing-data-bibliometrics-wg}{}); the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Alternative Assessment Metrics Initiative (\url{http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/}), which explicitly considers altmetrics for non-traditional products like software and data; and Making Data Count (\url{http://mdc.plos.org}), a collaboration between the California Digital Library, the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and DataONE to define a suite of Data Level Metrics (DLMs) and adapt the existing PLOS Article Level Metric (ALM) tool(\url{http://alm.plos.org}) to capture them.

% ==============================================================
% Methods and Demographics
% ==============================================================

To define useful data metrics, we must understand the values and needs of the researchers who create and re-use data, and of the data managers who preserve and publish it.
During the research phase of Making Data Count, we asked researchers and database or repository staff questions about data sharing, discovery, and metrics.
We solicited responses to a pair of online surveys via social media, listservs, and posts to CDL and PLOS blogs-- ultimately hearing from 247 researchers and 73 data managers in November and December of 2014.
Most researchers worked at academic institutions (78\%), and most were based in the United States (57\%) or United Kingdom (14\%).
Both academic (64\%) and government-run (22\%) repositories were significantly represented; repositories were primarily located in the United States (72\%) or United Kingdom (11\%).
Researchers from across the academic career spectrum responded; principal investigators (42\%), postdocs (21\%), and graduate students (19\%) were all well represented. 
Biology is the most popular discipline (53\%), but environmental (17\%) and social (10\%) science are also significantly represented. 


% ==============================================================
% Locations for sharing
% ==============================================================

To situate the collection and display of data metrics, we wanted to know where on the internet researchers go to share their data and to find data to use. 
Data sharing behavior has been relatively well-surveyed\cite{tenopir_data_2011, akers_disciplinary_2013, wallis_if_2013, aydinoglu_data_2014, kratz_researcher_2015}. 
Consistent with these previous surveys, direct transmission (e.g., via email) on request was the most common behavior: 74\% of respondents had shared some data this way and 16\% had shared ``most/all'' of their data that way.
Among the drawbacks to this approach-- including the potential for capricious denial of access-- is that it is invisible to measurement. 
Fortunately, researchers also often share over a more tractable channel: 71\% have published data in a database or repository.
Furthermore, the subset of researchers who shared the most were especially likely to do so that way; 57\% of the 94 respondents who shared most/all of their data put it in a database or repository.


% ==============================================================
% Information about data users
% ==============================================================

Data sharing on request may be popular because it enables researchers to know who is using their data for what purpose.
Data metrics available via public repositories might give researchers this information, while allowing data to be more readily available.
We asked researchers to rank their interest in five possible pieces of information about users of their data and, not surprisingly, the most detailed option was also the most popular.
``Name and contact information,'' was chosen as the most interesting by 48\% of researchers, much more than the less-specific options: discipline (32\%), institution type (8\%), institutional affiliation (6\%), and geographic location (5\%).
However, a substantial proportion (13\%) ranked this option last, and average interest in discipline was equally high.
When asked a similar question, data managers overwhelmingly chose discipline as the most interesting thing to know about users of their data (67\%).
In terms of current practice, repositories are split roughly in half between that collection extensive information-- a name (47\%), email address (44\%), and institutional affiliation (40\%)-- and not collecting any (47\%).


% ==============================================================
% Discovery & use
% ==============================================================

Compared to how scientists share data they have created, how and where they search for data in their role as (re-)users is not well understood.
We asked researchers how likely they would be to use each of five possible strategies (shown in Figure \ref{fig:results}a).
No single method predominated.
A 63\% majority said that they would ``definitely'' use more than one strategy, and three strategies would definitely be used by most respondents: searching via references in the literature (59\%), a discipline-specific database (58\%), or a general purpose search engine (51\%). 
When asked to name particular sources, the general-purpose repository Dryad (\url{http://datadryad.org/}) was most frequently mentioned ($n=16$); Google and ``journal articles'' were tied for second ($n=14$). 
Respondents were unlikely to `crowd-source' data discovery via open inquiries on social media (42\% ``no chance'') or discussion forums (40\% no chance).
However, direct inquiries to knowledgeable colleagues are probably more common, and were a relatively highly cited write-in source ($n=12$).

We next sought to characterize the role that public data plays in in respondents research processes by asking how frequently they used public data to generate ideas/hypotheses at the outset, to reach the main conclusion of a paper, or to support the main conclusion of a paper (Figure \ref{fig:results}b).
An overwhelming 96\% of respondents at least ``occasionally'' use public data in some capacity, and a 56\% majority used public data ``often.''
Furthermore much of this use is central to research, 28\% often and 42\% occasionally use public data to reach the main conclusions of a paper, although use for idea generation (41\% often, 46\% occasionally) and support (39\% often, 47\% occasionally) were higher.


% ==============================================================
% Data impact 
% ==============================================================

Among the potential audiences for data metrics-- administrators, funders, data managers-- dataset creators themselves are undoubtedly the most invested.
Metrics can provide researchers a sense of what their data is being used for and reassure them that it is being used and therefore that sharing is worthwhile.
Secondarily, data managers have a stake in knowing about use of their data to justify funding and tailor services.
We asked both groups what impact metrics they would most be interested in knowing about their data. 

For both groups, scholarly prestige is still measured in citations.
When asked to rank potential information about data use, 85\% of researchers (Figure \ref{fig:results}c) and 61\% of data managers chose citations as the most interesting thing to know about their data. 
The preference of researchers is consistent with previous surveys\cite{kratz_researcher_2015}.
Download count was a consistent second choice of researchers (by 64\%). 
Landing page views were ranked last by >50\% of both researchers and data managers.

As a practical matter, it is important to understand what metrics are already being tracked and exposed by repositories(Figure \ref{fig:results}d). 
Most repositories track downloads (85\%) and landing page views (66\%). 
However, only 35\% of the repositories that track downloads show them on the landing page or provide them through a program interface; this ratio is roughly similar for all of the metrics we asked about. 
Despite the extreme interest in citation counts, relatively few repositories (23\%) track them, presumably because this is much more challenging. 

% ==============================================================
% Conclusions & future work 
% ==============================================================

While citation counts are the gold standard, their current usefulness suffers from the major limitation that datasets are rarely cited formally.
The clearest illustration of current practice is a 2011 survey of social science papers that found that only 17\% cited the dataset with at least the title in the reference list, roughly the same as in 1995 
\cite{sieber_not_1995, mooney_citing_2011}. 
However, there are reasons for optimism.
Data creators strongly endorse formal data citation: 95\% of respondents to a 2011 DataONE survey agreed that formal citation was a fair condition for data sharing, as did 87\% of astrobiologists in a follow-up survey \cite{tenopir_data_2011, aydinoglu_data_2014}. 
Citation ``in the references like normal publications'' is the preferred method of receiving credit for data sharing by 71\% of biodiversity researchers and by 75\% of respondents to our earlier survey \cite{enke_users_2012, kratz_researcher_2015}.
In 2014, the scholarly communication community recognized the consensus that data used in an article should be cited formally in the reference list with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (\url{http://www.force11.org/node/4769}), and a number of organizations like DataCite, Future of Research Communication and e-Scholarship, and the Research Data Alliance are actively working to overcome the technical and cultural obstacles to widespread data citation.

Unlike citations, repositories can easily track dataset landing page views and downloads.
Page views considered to be of little value by researchers and data managers, but downloads are more highly regarded; it stands to reason that downloading a dataset represents a higher level of engagement that simply viewing the landing page.
For researchers, downloads were a very consistent second-choice to citations.
Furthermore, our previous work suggests that although the preference for citations is consistent, the gap in perceived value between the two metrics is relatively narrow \cite{kratz_researcher_2015}.
Downloads are already widely tracked by repositories, and we strongly recommend that more repositories make them public.
