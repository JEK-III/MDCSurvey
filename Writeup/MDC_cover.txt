Authors should provide a cover letter that includes the affiliation and contact information for the corresponding author, and that briefly explains why the work should be considered appropriate for Scientific Data. 

Authors should indicate whether they have had any prior discussions with a Scientific Data Editorial Board Member about the work described in the manuscript.

Dear Editors,

Attached you will find a Comment piece on metrics of dataset impact.
The need for data metrics is widely recognized and is an area of active work by a number of groups.
We are participating in Making Data Count, an NSF-funded project with PLOS and DataONE to develop a Dataset-Level Metrics tool. 
During the research phase of the project, we conducted a pair of surveys of data managers and researchers about data metrics.
We think that the results are relevant well beyond the project and would be of wide interest.

We asked ~250 researchers how they discover and re-use data, how they assess the quality and impact of other researchers, and what they would like to know about their own data. 
The questions for ~75 data managers focused on what metrics they currently collect, what they make public, and what they would like to know. 
From the replies, we can draw conclusions about the value and near-term practicality of various potential metrics.
For instance, citation counts are the metric of choice for both groups, but few repositories currently track them.
Download counts are a clear second-choice for researchers that most repositories do already track.
However, only ~1/3 of the repositories that count downloads make the counts public; increasing this fraction would be an 'easy win' for data metrics.

We discussed the piece and shared an earlier draft with Andrew Hufton.
That discussion resulted in a number of revisions, including better contextualization of this work relative to a survey we conducted previously and published elsewhere.
The underlying survey responses are publicly available (with a few potentially identifying questions redacted) from our repository (doi:10.5060/D8H59D or http://dash.ucop.edu/xtf/view?docId=ucop/ark%2B%3Db5060%3Dd8h59d/mrt-datacite.xml).
